## Introduction

### Overview
Hello! This student-authored guide serves to consolidate information and advice to help you best navigate SJSU's Computer Science program. 

This guide **is not** universally comprehensive or meant to replace other resources. Please use it as a starting point and/or supplement for official university resources. Anything written in this guide should be taken with a grain of salt as a precaution and double checked with an advisor. Program requirements can and do change, so do your due diligence.

### README.md <a name="readmesection"></a>
Let me emphasize that school (and life) isn't a race.

I realize that this guide places a lot of emphasis on "graduating efficiently", but please don't feel pressured to do so to the point where you sacrafice your mental health or activities that make you happy. We all of us have different priorities. School might not be your first, nor does it have to be.

Be honest with yourself about your circumstances, motivations, and capabilities. Find your own pace to pursue your degree at and you'll thrive. I promise.

## Program
The required courses for a CS degree are organized into (3) groups. More details about each can be found below.

<p align="center">

### University Requirements (GEs) <a name="ges"></a>
https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=12&navoid=4149

#### Physical Education (PE)
2 units of PE are required. Most PE classes are 1 unit, but some are more.

#### US123
US123 is the shorthand for three requirements: US1, US2, and US3. 
* Area D and US123 are almost always covered at the same time.
* Courses taken at community colleges can cover US123.
* If, by some stroke of (bad) luck, you’ve covered US12 but not 3 (this happened to me when I had APUSH and AP Government credit), you can try your hand at the [US3 Waiver Exam](https://www.sjsu.edu/testing/index.php?utm_source=testing&utm_medium=301&utm_campaign=testing-redesign). I can vouch for its difficulty having taken it myself.

All three requirements can be covered by taking HIST 15 (Essentials of U.S. History) and POLS 15 (Essentials of U.S. & California Government). **This is the most common route**.
* HIST 15 covers US1, Area D
* POLS 15 covers US2, US3, Area D
* Taking these two classes also satisfies the 6-unit Area D requirement. 

<details open>
<summary>Other sequences that cover Area D and US123</summary>
 
* AFAM 2A + AFAM 2B (African Americans and the Development of America's History and Government)
* AMS 1A + AMS 1B (American Cultures to 1877, American Cultures 1877 to Present)
* AAS 33A + AAS 33B (Asian Americans in U.S. History)
* CCS 10A + CCS 10B (Mexican Americans and the Development of U.S. History and Government)
* HUM 1A + HUM 1B, HUM 2A, HUM 2B (Humanities Honors, though I wouldn't recommend this program for CS majors).

|:-----:|:------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| A1   | Oral Communication                  | most students take COMM 20 (Public Speaking) or COMM 40 (Argumentation and Advocacy)                                 |
| A2   | Written Communication               | most students take ENGL 1A (First Year Writing)                                |

| B2   | Life Science                        |		most biology and chemistry classes, specific classes from geology and nutrition			  |
| B3   | Laboratory                          | fulfilled if your other Area B classes have a lab portion (most of them do). If not, there exists 1-unit labs you can take individually		                  |
| B4   | Mathematical Concepts               | :warning: an "intensive math" courses cover this. Math 30 is a major requirement and is considered an "intensive math" course, ***so you don't have to worry about this requirement***                                   |
| C1   | Arts                                | music and art                                   |

|<img width=20/>|<img width=300/>|<img width=1000/>|
#### Upper Division GEs
https://www.sjsu.edu/general-education/ge-requirements/upper-division.php

* You'll have to finish the [***Upper-Division Writing Directed Self Placement***](https://www.sjsu.edu/wac/wst/) before enrolling in RSVZ classes.
* You'll need to be "upper divison standing" which usually means you will have 60 units out of the 120 to graduate by the time you take this class. I think there might be some flexibility here for edge cases, but ask your advisor.

| GE | Area                                          | Notes |

### Major Preparation <a name="majorprep"></a>

#### Required Classes
| Code    | Course            | Notes |
|:-----------:|:------------------------------------|:-------|
| MATH 30  | Calculus 1       |       |
| MATH 31  | Calculus 2       |       |
| MATH 42  | Discrete Math    |       |
| MATH 39  | Linear Algebra 1 |       |
| PHIL 134 | Computers, Ethics, and Society                 |       |
|<img width=200/>| <img width=300/>| <img width=1000/> |

#### Approved Science Electives (CSCI Science Electives)
<details open>
<summary>Official Requirement Details (click me, I'm a dropdown!)</summary>
 
+ 14 units total are required
+ At least 5 units must come from Special Science Electives Courses (PHYS 50, PHYS 51, CHEM 1A, BIOL 31, BIOL 30, GEOL 1, GEOL 4L, GEOL 7, METR 10)
+ The remaining 9 units can be Special Science Electives, GE Science Courses, or an Area R course
</details>

<details open>
<summary>What It Means</summary>
 
* Basically, the CS department is saying “plz take an extra science class or two” but veils it in this super confusing 14-unit requirement.
* Since so many classes cover both this requirement and certain GEs, if you choose classes strategically, it’s likely you’ll only need to take a single “extra” science+lab class for full coverage.

</details>

<details open>
<summary>Covering This Requirement</summary>
 
* Your classes for GE Area B1 (Physical Science) and B2 (Life Science) will cover at least **6 units**
    * Strategically choose your classes for B1 and B2 so that they double-dip into the 6-unit Special Science Electives Courses requirement (Example: PHYS 50 for B1/B3, GLST 1B for B2 is already 6 units)
* B3 (Lab Science) will cover at least 1 unit, for a total of **7 units**
* Your Area R course will automatically cover (at least) 3 units, for a total of **10 units**
* Assuming 7 units from Area B and 3 from Area R, **you’ll only need 4 more units at most**. That’s one 4-unit science + lab class.

</details>

#### Advanced Math (choose 1 of the 3)

| MATH 161A    | Applied Probability and Statistics  |       |
|<img width=150/>|<img width=300/>|<img width=1000/>|

### Major Requirements <a name="majorrequirements"></a>
No wiggle room here. These classes are all required.

#### Lower Division Requirements
| Code    | Course            | Notes |

| CS 47 | Introduction to Computer Systems |       |
|<img width=150/>| <img width=300/>| <img width=1000/> |

> :warning: **Note**: The lower division requirements are the only CS courses you can transfer from Community Colleges. You’ll easily find CC courses that cover all three of the courses listed above, but not for anything below. See the [Community College](#communitycollege) section for more details.

#### Upper Division Requirements
| Code    | Course            | Notes |
|:---------:|:---------------------------------------------|:-------|
| CS 146  | Data Structures and Algorithms              |       |

|<img width=170/>| <img width=260/>| <img width=1160/> |

### Electives <a name="electives"></a>
You'll need to take 14 units of electives. Since (basically) every CS elective is 3 units, **so you'll have to take 5 CS electives.**

I'm not going to list the electives I chose because there's such a huge variety of both elective options and things you can do with your degree. I believe there's a lot of value exploring on your own to find what you like. And since I'm not exactly going into industry, my recommendations might not be the most relevant anyways.

Ask professors and advisors about electives that pique your interest. They are all established in their field in some way and have far more insight on electives and their relevance for industry than I do. Ask alumni working in the fields you're interested in through LinkedIn. Ask upperclassmen. Supplement your own knowledge and interest in certain electives with the **collective** insights of others.

I made a [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tZjIYEdGjUZg-vztMmSd8zEpPA0KH2yOFF7CaeHGrgE/edit) that allows you to group electives based on interest. Pairing this with your 4-year plan should make advising meetings smooth as butter, and you can also ask your advisors about the electives you want more info on.

## Planning

### MyProgress
[MyProgress Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHrxvDwARlY&feature=emb_title)

MyProgress is an incredibly useful tool built into the SJSU website that allows you to see exactly what requirements you have fulfilled, are in the progress of completing, or still need. There are plenty or resources available introducing the service and the university (rightfully) pushes it pretty hard. I’ll give you the rundown here, but you can always find more detailed tutorials online.

This service is **indispensable**. I cannot emphasize this enough. Use it to make your 4-year plan, determine which courses to take, see what areas your AP credits and CC classes cover, raise your children, and more.

<details open>
<summary>How to navigate to MyProgress</summary>
 
1. Navigate to **MySJSU**
2. Under **Academics**, click **My Academics**
3. Click **View My Progress Report**
</details>

All you need to know about reading the interface is introduced at the top of the page when you generate your MyProgress report. Explore and get used to the interface. Be ready to use it to prepare for course selection and advising meetings.

> :warning: **Tip:** The only little quirk that I didn't see explained by the interface or tutorials is that if you need to fulfill a requirement that has a number of different course options, you can pull up the entire list of classes that cover said requirement directly in MyProgress.

<p align="center">
<img width="577" alt="Screen Shot 2021-04-30 at 7 11 20 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66895883/170851136-4aac97fa-7f01-4dea-b29c-792adc0a9b90.png">
</p>

### 4-Year Plan <a name="fouryear"></a>
A 4-year plan is very useful for advising meetings. It also gives you a good idea of your graduation timing, required classes, and long-term university plan as a whole.

You can build an official 4-year plan in MyPlanner. Though, personally, I just made a table listing the remaining classes I needed adapted from MyProgress and roughly organized it into 4 years. For example, I would go back to the [Program](#program) section and write all the still-needed classes into a table, then cross-reference it with MyProgress to make sure all requirements were covered. Do whatever works best for you.

I certainly don’t believe that I could have accurately selected the CS electives I wanted to take in my first semester. It’s perfectly fine to just write “CS Elective” as filler in your personal list, then fill that list in as you explore.

As a general extension of the previous paragraph, if you have other requirements that you’re unsure which class you’ll take for, leave it as the requirement name. For example, write Area R instead of a specific course if you’re unsure which Area R course you’d like to take. The 4-year plan is less of a concrete plan and more of a “covering requirements” plan.

If you enter SJSU without a single unit of external credit, you’ll need to take an average of 15 units every semester (roughly 5 classes, since some classes are more or less than 3 units) to graduate in 4 years. Of course, this assumes you get the classes you want every single time, don’t fail a class, and don’t make any mistakes choosing classes. It’s good to be on the safe side and reduce course strain/pressure by following the advice in [Getting Ahead](#gettingahead).

A 4-year plan is actually required (at least back in 2019) if you want to apply for the CA Promise Program (see [Registration](#registration). In that case, follow the instructions the program provides and you can build an “official” 4-year plan on the website they give. “Official” doesn’t mean final, so don’t fret if you don’t have a solid vision of what your long-term university plan is.

<details open>
<summary>Tips for plan design</summary>
 
* Take CS 146 as soon as you possibly can (right after CS 46B). It’s the prerequisite course for nearly all other upper-division CS courses and will open your course options up significantly.
* Don’t stack too many difficult CS classes at once. **You can check out difficulty rankings in**
* Some GEs are difficult and/or time consuming, and others are a cakewalk. Make sure not to dismiss all GEs as “easy” and use them as schedule fillers. Do your research.
* I finished all of my major requirements without mixing in more than a single elective. I now feel I would’ve had a more balanced schedule if I mixed more electives in.
* Major requirements are generally more difficult than electives (though there certainly are exceptions)
* Mark classes that can be taken at CC or during SJSU’s Summer/Winter sessions. If you ever need to get ahead, those will be your first targets.
* Triple check that you’ll have the (co)prerequisites of a course complete before you write that class into your plan
* Some courses (almost exclusively upper division CS electives) are **only offered during Fall or Spring**. I strongly recommend that you check past semesters’ listings of the electives you wish to take to make sure the course offering aligns with your plan.

</details>

### Choosing Classes <a name="choosingclasses"></a>
Your best bet is to follow the [official tutorial](https://www.sjsu.edu/classes/register/index.php) for this.

**First-time Freshmen:** 

Choosing classes for your first semester is different. You’ll choose classes on your orientation date, and you’ll be blocked into your required classes (the school will reserve important major classes for you). For example, if you have CS 46A credit, your reserved classes at orientation will probably be CS 46B and Math 42. In my experience, you’ll usually have one or two section options to choose from for each class. Past those blocked in classes, any other class is basically a free-for-all, and having an earlier orientation date will be advantageous. If your orientation date is later, having to be a bit less picky about GEs is really the only disadvantage.

**Here are some niche tips the tutorials might not cover:** 
* You can expand Additional Search Criteria to make more specific queries (online, offline, meeting times, meeting days, professor)
   * If you open the Requirement Designation dropdown, you can specify exactly what GE area you want to cover
* Add all sections of a desired course to your shopping cart to keep an eye on them
   * Sometimes, class details/times aren’t finalized
   * You’ll have to add the classes to your cart one at a time, but it’s worth it.
* MyPlanner (another built-in MySJSU service) allows you to easily make a visual weekly schedule from classes in your MySJSU shopping cart.

### CS Course Difficulties <a name="difficulty"></a>
It’s important to have a good idea of how difficult the required classes are so you can avoid stacking too many of the difficult ones into the same semester. Note that your mileage may vary drastically based on your professor and your own strengths/weaknesses. 

> :warning: **Note:** These ratings are crowdsourced from the CS student body at SJSU. Take them with a grain of salt. Students have different learning styles and strengths. These students take these classes with different professors, all with different teaching styles.
 
Rankings are on a scale from 1-10.

### GE Recommendations <a name="gerecs"></a>
For GEs (especially Area RSV), I often prioritized “easiness” over other factors since I was taking difficult CS upper-division courses at the same time.

If your objective is similar, you may consider the following courses. I’ve bolded what I ended up taking, but everything listed would have been fine options. Your mileage may vary based on the professor, so do your due diligence. I’d also love to add more course recommendations—please do shoot me a message/email.

### Professors <a name="professors"></a>

Similar to the CS electives sections, I'm going to refrain from Professor recommendations. First, I was only taught by a small portion of the CS faculty. Second, it's better for you gather insight from a variety of sources since everyone's experiences are so subjective. This guide seeks to be mainly informative rather than [recommendative](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/recommendative) (surprise surprise, that's a word!).

**My Thoughts on RateMyProfessor:**
RateMyProfessor ratings are usually very biased. Students who recieve a high grade tend to leave positive reviews, while those who don't tend to leave negative reviews. And since the CS department teaches difficult classes, negative reviews are pretty common. It's also more likely for someone to leave a review only if they had a negative experience with the class.

In my opinion, the most reliable reviews are from those who receive a good grade but leave a bad review or receive a bad grade but leave a good review. 

If a professor **only** has bad reviews, I’d err on the side of caution. But more common is a professor with a handful of positive reviews and a ton of medicore ones, resulting in an unimpressive average score. Usually, these professors are solid but teach difficult courses and/or are strict. I've had plenty of wonderful professors with mediocre reviews. Their classes were difficult. Take that as you will.

Students who perform averagely or don’t have any strong feelings about a class/professor usually won’t leave RMP reviews. I’d encourage you to be the change and leave reviews for all of your professors, even if the class wasn’t memorable or you didn’t have a good time. I’d also highly encourage you to focus your review on the professor’s teaching rather than how you did in the class. CS is not an easy major, and course content being difficult isn’t necessarily the professor’s fault.

It’s also a good idea to be honest with yourself and your personal ability when reading reviews. How would you rate yourself in terms of learning speed, dedication, work ethic, and free time compared to the average SJSU student? You can use such a metric to determine which reviewers are most similar to you and get a vague idea of how you would do in a class.

To summarize my advice: A professor with mediocre reviews isn’t necessarily a bad professor. Ask upperclassmen if you want more specific insight.

### Online Classes <a name="onlineclasses"></a>
**Should I take online classes?**

With the COVID pandemic, all classes moved online for 2.5 semesters. Since basically all classes have some online foundation and/or format now, I’d expect online counterparts to classes to be more common in the future, even as in-person teaching returns. ***2022 me checking in, I was right 😭***

Online learning is extremely hit-or-miss for people. It was a “hit” for me because I no longer had to commute to and from school (I lived off campus) and was basically at my computer all day anyways. Your mileage may vary.

Learning on Zoom is not for everybody. Distractions are far more prevalent and there’s really nobody to stop you from being distracted. Taking difficult classes online requires solid dedication, so be honest with yourself in determining whether or not some online options are for you. I’m no bastion of work ethic and would often find myself on my phone during class. If you might do the same, you had better be willing to commit just as much class-time you miss into reviewing video lectures, because I certainly did.

It’s still unclear how common online classes will be in the future, but like I said, I predict more and more classes will have online options in the coming years.

**Asynchronous Classes**

Asynchronous classes (no formal meeting time) are generally less effort overall compared to synchronous counterparts. You’ll basically never see an asynchronous CS class, but they’re pretty common for some GEs.

There will definitely be more assignments for asynchronous classes, but these courses are generally self-paced for the entire semester or in weekly/bi-weekly chunks. If you’re confident in your ability to self-pace and not fall behind (because falling behind in an asynchronous class can be even worse than doing so in a synchronous one), asynchronous options may save time and effort.

**Hybrid Classes**

There are many class meeting styles that fall under this category, so the classification itself isn’t terribly useful. Your mileage will vary greatly depending on how your professor decides to teach their class. Check the class notes for a class when searching/enrolling to potentially get more information about a course’s meeting schedule.

## Getting Ahead <a name="gettingahead"></a>

### AP Credits <a name="apcredits"></a>
https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=12&navoid=4077
Back in my matriculation year (2019-20), SJSU gave credit for all scores 3 and higher. Now, a 3 still nets you credit, but a 4-5 may net more for certain requirements.

For the most part, MyProgress will do the work for you. You can manually check that your AP credits are being counted for course credit there. I’ve included the AP credits that are most important for CS majors below as of Spring 2022:

| Exam                        | Score | Coverage                                                                                                  |
|:-----------------------------|:-------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Calculus AB                 | 3     | MATH 30                                                                                                   |
| Calculus BC                 | 3     | MATH 30 and MATH 31                                                                                       |
| Computer Science A          | 3     | CS 46A                                                                                                    |
| Computer Science Principles | 3     | Elective Credit, GE Area B4.</br> :warning: Note that but this isn’t considered the CS Electives that the major requires |
|<img width=200/>|<img width=50/>|<img width=1000/>|

SJSU also grants credit for [CLEP](https://testing.sjsu.edu/clep/) (College Level Examination Program), but I don’t have any experience with it.

### Community College <a name="communitycollege"></a>
Community College (CC) classes are a good way to take the pressure off of the “15 units per semester” requirement to graduate in 4 years. They are far cheaper than taking Winter/Summer classes at SJSU and are usually easier across the board.

SJSU runs on a semester system, so transferring units from a school running on a quarter system results in decimal unit counts. If you’re trying to hit a numerical unit count minimum (The 14-unit CSCI requirement comes to mind), be extra careful: 4 unit courses at a quarter-based school will not be 4 units at SJSU. Otherwise, quarter units will cover GE/major requirements even if they are only 2.67 units upon translation. You can check if a school is quarter or semester based with a simple Google search. 

Here's a quarter/semester conversion chart:

<p align="center">
<img  alt="Screen Shot 2021-04-30 at 7 11 20 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66895883/170852897-7bcf8f9b-241e-460b-89af-12c39760c84e.png">
</p>

**Articulation Agreements** 

...are transfer equivalency agreements between SJSU and another school.

If you want cover a major requirement: [Major Specific Articulation](http://transfer.sjsu.edu/web-dbgen/artic/all-course-to-course.html) 

If you want to cover a GE requirement: [GE Articulation](http://transfer.sjsu.edu/web-dbgen/artic/all-ge.html)

To check if an SJSU requirement you wish to cover can be covered at a CC, find the CC you wish to take courses at and look for SJSU’s version of the course. For example, if you wish to cover CS 46A at DeAnza College, look for CS 46A on DeAnza’s Course-to-Course Articulation page.

<p align="center">
<img width="800" alt="Screen Shot 2021-04-30 at 7 11 20 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66895883/170852984-7dcc3f5b-ade1-456c-b2b0-874d51747860.png">
</p>

It’s admittedly a bit unclear what exactly clears CS 46A due to the AND and ORs. It’s clear whoever designed these requirements is putting their CS degree to good use. If you have any doubts, ask your advisor.

Note that some schools/courses don’t have direct articulation agreements. I believe you can try to petition for [Transfer Equivalency](https://www.sjsu.edu/essc/coe-undergraduate-advising/transfer-credit/transfer-equivalency.php) in this case, but your case needs to be airtight.

Another resource to find equivalent transfer courses is [assist.org](https://assist.org/), which generates a list of course agreements between two colleges. Note that the website can be inconsistent at times (SJSU + De Anza’s agreements seem to be missing a few), so I’d encourage you to use the articulation links above as your primary source.

**Community College Recommendations**

* Semester: Ohlone, San Jose City, Mission, West Valley
* Quarter: De Anza, Foothill (these two share a portal, which makes ordering transcripts easy)

**Further Advice**

* If you’re an incoming freshman...
   * ...consider taking a summer class to knock out a major requirement (or GE)
   * ...and do not have credit for CS 46A or 46B, consider taking the next course in your path (46A → 46B → 146) at CC the summer before your first college semester. As previously mentioned, 146 is basically the mother of all CS prerequisites, so doing this will shift your CS-specific plan one semester forwards.
      * If you do this, you’ll need to ask for an [add code](#waitlistsandaddcodes) for the next class down the line, as you wouldn’t have the necessary prerequisites by the time you register for classes. This does give you a good excuse to get the add code early.
* Send your CC transcripts ASAP, especially if those classes are prerequisites. The team that handles transcripts usually takes at least 5-6 weeks to update your information after receiving them.
* You’ll need to apply for the CC to attend. Check the specific college’s website for instructions.
* As students at a 4-year university, your registration priority won’t be super high. Be prepared with a list of classes and don’t expect to get your first choice.
* In general, summer classes tend to fill up very quickly. Apply early and have a list of backup classes.
* CCs will basically never have classes that cover upper division courses. For CS majors, this means CS 46A, CS 46B, and CS 47 mark the end of transferable major requirements. Most people use CC to knock out GE requirements anyways, but keep this in mind.
 
### Special Sessions <a name="specialsessions"></a>
SJSU offers select courses during the [Winter](https://www.sjsu.edu/winter/schedule/) and [Summer](https://www.sjsu.edu/summer/) sessions. Winter courses usually last only a month but are incredibly time consuming. Expect to meet multiple days of the week for hours at a time. 

You’ll have more options for Summer courses, but I’d assume looking for a specific class narrows down your scheduling options. This screenshot is pulled directly from the webpage linked above for the Summer of 2022. The 10-week session is still faster paced than the traditional semester class, but is more manageable.

<p align="center">
<img width="800" alt="Screen Shot 2021-04-30 at 7 11 20 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66895883/170853160-2c231acc-5144-46c7-879a-302d87d94deb.png">
</p>

* **The costs are incredibly steep if you don’t have a FAFSA scholarship.** I’d strongly encourage against enrolling in a special session for courses that have equivalencies at community colleges, and I’d simply enroll at the community college instead. There may be exceptions for popular classes (like CS 46A) you aren’t confident you can get at a CC, but even then, I’d try my hand at CC first.

* **I’d consider enrolling in special session courses for classes without community college equivalencies.** For example, you can’t take Area RSV courses before taking CS 100W. You may consider taking CS 100W in the Summer session to open your course options up.

* Taking CS 146 earlier also opens your course options significantly given that it is the prerequisite for nearly all upper-division CS courses. However, the class is already challenging on a normal semester schedule and will be even more difficult in the Summer/Winter. Tread with caution.

* To find courses offered during summer, use the MySJSU class search function. The process detailed in [Choosing Classes](#choosingclasses) can be used by changing the desired term to “Summer” or “Winter”.

* Let me remind you again that [It’s not a race](#readmesection). Be honest with yourself, know your capabilities, and don’t sacrifice mental health just to graduate a semester early.

### Unit Overloading <a name="unitoverloading"></a>
I’m not going to discuss this in detail as unit overloading is generally discouraged unless you’re confident you can complete extra units or desperately need to overload. This is here just so you know it's possible.

You can look into the [unit limits](https://www.sjsu.edu/registrar/registration/enrollment-limit-waitlist.php#:~:text=All%20Undergraduate%20students%20have%20an,Friday%2C%20June%2024%2C%202022.) and [petitions](https://www.sjsu.edu/registrar/forms/) here:

You can also “unofficially” overload if you take a class at a Community College during your semesters. The more official way to take classes at another college concurrently can be found in [Special Enrollment Programs](https://www.sjsu.edu/registrar/registration/special-enrollment-programs/index.php). I think going through the official process saves you some tuition fees at the second institution, but don't quote me. 

Once again, be honest with yourself and your capabilities if you overload units.

## Advising & Registration <a name="advisingandregistration"></a>
Your advisor is human. They make mistakes. And while there are certainly “bad” advisors here at SJSU, there are many good ones, and doing your due diligence will make your experiences with advisors—regardless of how “good” they are—much smoother. I’ve never actually had a bad advising experience, but I’m not sure whether that’s because I always came overly prepared or if I got lucky.

Use MyProgress to its fullest. Build a 4-year plan (it doesn’t have to be final), have a course plan for next semester, and have a general idea of what topics you enjoy or want to explore. Doing so before each advising meeting will only benefit you.

### Holds

Every semester, COSAC (College of Science Advising Center) places a hold on science students that require them to meet with their advisor. Otherwise, they are unable to view registration dates on release or enroll in courses for the next semester. The following search will give you all the information you need to sign up for an appointment:

[COSAC Advising](https://www.sjsu.edu/cosac/advising/)

For students who have not yet passed CS 146, major advising is general. Schedule an appointment early (set your appointment date to around mid-semester), because the schedule fills in quickly and you don’t want to be that student that can’t enroll in classes on registration day because they forgot to remove their hold.

[SJSU CS Advisors](https://www.sjsu.edu/cs/students/advising/advisors.php)

Advising differs for students that have passed CS 146. Once you do, you’re assigned a CS faculty member who you’re responsible for contacting on your own to schedule an appointment with. Follow this search for the list of advisors:

Advisors will not plan out your next semester classes for you (unless the classes are absolutely required and there is no variation), and you’ll be fully responsible for doing so. Before your meeting, be prepared with at least your course plan for the next semester (and ideally more than that). 

> :warning: **Note:** Advisors are there to tweak, advise, and approve your plan, not to make it.

### Registration <a name="registration"></a>
Registration dates are usually released a few months before the new semester, but you won’t be able to see them until your holds are removed (which is why this section is coupled with Advising). You can find the registration dates for your specific semester on [SJSU's official calendar](https://www.sjsu.edu/registrar/calendar/).

When you do remove your holds, navigate to MySJSU, and you should see Enrollment Dates on the right sidebar. Click Details and change the term if necessary. Here's a tutorial, if needed.

<p align="center">
<img width="300" alt="Screen Shot 2021-04-30 at 7 11 20 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66895883/170853579-9c656add-e222-4838-be04-60ed6e9cbc84.png">
</p>

**How Registration Priority Works**

Basically, being in certain groups will give you earlier registration dates and times. General rules of thumb are as follows, but click the link above for more details:

* Graduating Seniors → Seniors → Juniors → Sophomores → Freshman
   * You have to apply for graduation status (usually during the semester before you hit 90 units or have 2 more semesters left), and there’s a deadline for your application if you wish to have priority registration the next semester. Find the specific deadline and plan ahead.
* Special Groups (highest priority): note-takers, athletes, veterans, etc…
* If you fail a class and want to retake it, your priority is lower

**Note Taking** 

 I’ve never done note-taking myself, so I don’t know much about it. Basically, you take notes and send to those with AEC (Accessible Education Center) needs (e.g. disabilities). I’m not sure how consistent getting the role is or anything else about it. If this is something you’d be interested in, I would ask around.

**California Promise Program** 

Another way to receive a sooner registration time is to join the [SJSU California Promise Program](https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=10&navoid=762). From my understanding, this program won’t allow you to “hop out” of your group (a Freshman in the program is still lower priority than all Sophomores), but will make you a priority within your group.

### Waitlists & Add Codes <a name="waitlistsandaddcodes"></a>
SJSU’s waitlist technically becomes useless on the first day of instruction. The professor can save the waitlist order themselves, but if you aren’t actually enrolled in the class by the first day, consider the waitlist nonexistent.

One way to still get enrollment in a course once the semester begins is through an **add code**. Professors usually have a handful of add codes they can give out that allow the student count to exceed the “class enrollment limit”.

All professors have their own rules for giving out add codes. Some may not give out any. Rules of thumb are as follows:

Professors will generally prioritize graduating seniors, then based on seniority
* Some professors grant codes on a first come first serve basis
* Some professors grant codes based on waitlist order before the waitlist became useless
* Some professors draw lots (I literally had a professor do this my freshman year)
* Some professors grant add codes on the last possible day (weeks into the semester) to weed out competing students

Regardless of how the professor whose class you’re interested in grants add codes, you can maximize your chances in the following ways:
* Knowing the date, time, and professor of the course you want to add
   * Email the professor before the semester begins, explain your current position (waitlisted, etc.) and ask about their add code policy (see Email Etiquette)
* If the class is online, try to find a Zoom link for the first day from enrolled students
   * Alternatively, you can email the professor to kindly ask for a zoom link
* Attend the first day of class (online or in-person)
* Some professors ask if there are any “people trying to add”
   * Others won’t, and it is your responsibility to talk to them at the end of class, find them in office hours, or find another way to meet
   * Don’t be pushy when asking. First impressions are very important.
        
> :warning: **Warning:** Receiving an add code for a popular course, especially if you're not a graduating senior, is extremely inconsistent. Make sure you’re already enrolled for a backup class that you can later drop if you receive an add code for the desired course.

## Transfers

### Transfer Registration <a name="transferregistration"></a>
Transfers I’ve talked to were able to enroll in classes before their final CC quarters were over and had their final transcripts sent in. For a more specific reference, they were able to register for Fall 2021 classes starting June 9th, 2021.

Your registration date will be later than all students who are already attending, but this actually isn’t as bad as it sounds. You’re essentially locked from taking CS electives anyways since all of them require 146—assuming you took the CS 46B and CS 47 equivalencies at your CC, the two most relevant CS classes you’ll have access to are CS 146 (Data Structures and Algorithms) and CS 147 (Computer Architecture). The department knows that these are major required courses and makes sure to provide plenty of sections for transfers and 4-year students alike.

### Transfer Advising <a name="transferadvising"></a>
Advising for transfer students (especially if you start in a Fall semester) is weird. During summer, the traditional advisors list are (hopefully) enjoying their summers and aren’t obligated to advise. Hence, if the timing of your class enrollment period falls during the summer, refer to the [CS advising page](https://www.sjsu.edu/cs/advising/advisors.php) for who to contact for advising during the summer (usually a specific email or the CS department mailbox).

If you’re seeking advice not during the summer and you haven’t passed CS 146 (which should be the norm if you’re an incoming transfer), I believe you should contact COSAC for advising. You can find more details on advising in the [Holds](#holds) section.

### Choosing Your First Semester Classes <a name="firstsemclasses"></a>
CS 146 is a must-have. It single handedly unlocks the vast majority of CS electives and CS major requirements, so take it as soon as possible.

**Major Requirements that don't require CS 146**
* CS 151: Object-Oriented Programming
* CS 154: Formal Languages & Computability
* CS 147: Computer Architecture

From there, the rest of your class list depends on how much time and effort you’re willing to spend on school. I’ll refer to the same 2-year plan linked above. My suggestions are as follows:
* Take 4-5 classes your first semester, and take it a little easier as the CC → university transition can be difficult (rigor, environment, etc.)
* Take CS 146 as soon as possible
* Taking CS 151 early won’t hurt, and you can essentially treat it like an “Advanced X” class where you mainly learn about good object-oriented programming practices in X language (my professor used Java, but I hear some professors use other common languages)
* In addition to CS 146, I’d suggest taking at most two more “difficult” classes (and strongly suggest only one). Fill the rest in with easier classes. Of course, you know your capabilities the best, so you make the call at the end of the day.
   * Difficult classes include: Advanced Math (MATH 32, 142, 161A), CS 147
   * Medium difficulty classes: CS 151, CS 154 (heavily professor dependent, see the Major Requirement Difficulty section in COURSES)
   * Easy (but potentially time consuming) classes include: CS 100W, PHIL 134, Area R, Area S
   * You can see my full thoughts/recommendations on the classes (and Areas R/S) above in the [GE Recommendations](#gerecs) section.
* Some example schedules:
   * CS 146, CS 147, CS 100W, PHIL 134, Area R
   * CS 146, Advanced Math, CS 100W, Area R, CS 151
   * CS 146, CS 151, CS 100W, PHIL 134, Area S

### 2-Year Plan <a name="twoyearplan"></a>
The CS department has a 2-year plan for transfer students. The 2020-21 plan assumes you took 46A/B in a different language at CC and need 49J, and thus suggests taking 146 in your second semester. Their plan also assumes you have a PE-waiver. CS transfers, unlike those who enter as freshman, do qualify for a PE waiver. This information can be found in [Major Exceptions and Modifications for GE and SJSU Studies](https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=10&navoid=664).

Your required classes are the same as a 4-year student excluding lower division GEs and basic major classes (CS 46A, CS 46B, CS 47, Math 42, PHYS 50, PHYS 51, MATH 30, MATH 31). You can find a detailed list of the classes you need in the [Program](#program) section, and advice for building a plan can be found in the [Planning](#planning) section.

## Outside the Classroom <a name="outsidetheclassroom"></a>

### Student Organizations <a name="studentorganizations"></a>
Student organizations are great networking opportunities and offer a sense of community often devoid given SJSU’s “commuter school” status. Many CS/engineering-oriented organizations host speakers and provide easy access to projects, career guidance, and internship/job opportunities.

You can find all SJSU recognized clubs here. Google search SJSU Clubs and Groups if the link breaks. Note that many, many of these clubs are inactive.

I’ve gathered a list of active CS/CE clubs I’m aware of below. If you want your club added to the list, please email me with the name of the club and (if applicable) additional information and links.

* [Machine Learning Club](https://mlatsjsu.club/)
* [Software & Computer Engineering Society (SCE)](https://sce.engr.sjsu.edu/)
* [CS Club](https://officialcsclubsjsu.wixsite.com/mysite)
* [Hoplite](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sjsu-hoplite) (interview prep club)
* Girls Who Code

### Internships
I'm not going to discuss the actual internship hunt/interview process because I am absolutely not qualified to dish out advice about it. There are far more insightful resources out there discussing how you can a CS internship. That being said, I have added some advice on studying and how best to tackle Leetcode based on my experience with Leetcode and several standardized tests.

**What is Leetcode?**

LeetCode is a game that you have to play if you want to maximize your chances of landing an internship. If you’re unaware of what it is, “first round interviews” for companies will often ask a handful of “puzzle-like” questions from competitive programming sites like LeetCode. It’s an easy way to filter out candidates, but is widely frowned upon by experienced developers. The sentiment I usually hear among them is that the memorization and puzzle skills these LeetCode interviews test really aren’t useful in a real work environment.

That said, advocates for Leetcode argue that the competitive programming questions establish for candidates a cognitive standard university enrollment itself may not prove in confidence. It also levels the playing field since you can study Leetcode and see great improvement. 

As more and more people are learning to LeetCode, companies up the difficulty of their interview questions to match rising performance—prompting a vicious cycle. Today, Leetcode is nearly unavoidable for most major CS internship/job roles. You’ll have to play the game if you want to maximize your chances.

Most data structures tested in these competitive programming questions will be taught in CS 146 (Data Structures and Algorithms), but CS 146 **does not teach you how to Leetcode**!

**Advice on Leetcode**

* [Hoplite](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sjsu-hoplite) is an interview-prep club here at SJSU.
* You are going to suck at the beginning. There’s no way around it, no magical shortcut.
* Leetcode tests very specific skills, memorization being a huge one
  * There are a reasonable, finite number of problem categories, and the solutions within each category generally utilize the same handful of techniques. For example, I’ve seen many, many different problems that all have the same solution with minor adaptations: the [Window Sliding Technique](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/window-sliding-technique/).
  * You don’t have to come up with a novel, brilliant solution to every problem you see. The goal is that you will have done that specific problem before or will have done a problem similar enough and remember the general tools/steps you used so that the challenge isn’t reinventing the wheel, but making small adaptations based on problem-specific requirements.
  * When I emphasize the importance of memorization, I do not mean memorizing each and every problem and its solution line-by-line. I mean memorizing the techniques used to solve these problems so that these techniques can be generalized to solve a larger number of other problems.
Repetition is incredibly important for memorization. Make sure your studying isn’t strictly linear (like completely studying X, moving on to study Y and never touching X again until the end). A better plan: Study X, Study Y, after Y review X and make sure you still remember it, etc...
  * If you find yourself stuck on a problem, do not hesitate to the look at the answer. Your goal in studying is that you'll be familiar with the type of questions thrown at you in interviews, not so you can pride yourself in finding a solution from scratch (this is a nice skill to have, but isn't super relevant for Leetcode interviews)
* Comfortably learn the data structures used in subsets of LeetCode problems (from CS 146 or externally) before grinding out the problems themselves.
* Choose a single language you’re comfortable with for problems and stick with it. The easiest one to use is Python because the language is very hand-holdy and has a ton of built-in functions.
* You can find the exact problems many companies use (or used recently) online

**Advice on Finding Internships** 

* [Here’s](https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2015/01/30/the-10-best-websites-for-finding-an-internship/?sh=3dd05df01b44) an article discussing the best websites to find internships on
* All SJSU students have access to [Handshake](https://sjsu.joinhandshake.com/stu). It's a solid platform that allows you to easily apply to jobs geared towards students.
* Internships for “big companies” usually close by December or January, so plan your studying/internship hunting around those deadlines if you’re interested in that.
* Internships are a huge numbers game, and have a tough barrier of entry if you don’t have past internships. Generally speaking, quantity > quality when looking for your first role. 

### Networking
This world runs on nepotism whether you like it or not. As social creatures, we’re more likely to be lenient and want to do favors for people we're familiar with.

This guide really isn’t meant to give networking advice, but I will say that having a network makes it far easier to find job opportunities and whatnot. Anecdotally, networking helped the co-contributor land herself an internship her Sophomore year. As she says: “Connect with people on LinkedIn, reach out for help, and grow your circle.”

I’d like to add that professors are also invaluable to have in a network and may present opportunities if you have a good relationship with them and ask nicely.

Also, networking doesn’t just mean sending out LinkedIn requests to every professional profile you come across in hopes that they publicly post a job opportunity or something. It’s often quality over quantity. Reach out to alumni and professionals in the fields you're interested in. Ask them questions about their career trajectory, education, background. Be professional, appreciative, and kind.

## Miscellaneous

### Switching into CS <a name="switchingintocs"></a>

[Department of Computer Science: Change of Major Policy](https://www.sjsu.edu/cs/students/undergrad-students/change-of-major.php)

Due to multiple people asking, I’m writing a small section on how to switch into CS. The most updated information can be found with the search query above. PLEASE CHECK THESE REQUIREMENTS YOURSELF AND MEET WITH AN ADVISOR (generally one from your major) IF YOU HAVE ANY DOUBTS.

The process to switch majors into CS is deliberately difficult. Demand for the major is so high relative to supply that I can’t imagine advisors aren’t burned out facilitating the process for likely hundreds of prospects every semester, so don’t take it personally if you feel there are significant delays during communication with advisors.

Contact COSAC if you have additional questions.

**DO NOT MISS THE APPLICATION DEADLINES!**

Applications are accepted twice a year
If you want to be a CS major by Spring semester (the second semester in an academic year), you must apply December 1st.
If you want to be a CS major by Fall semester (the first semester in an academic year) you must apply by May 1st.
DOUBLE CHECK THESE DEADLINES ON YOUR OWN!

**Classes you need to take before applying**
* For students with less than 60 units, there are four classes you need to take before you submit a Change of Major application: CS 46A + CS 46B (Introduction to Programming Classes), and MATH 42 (Discrete Math). CS 49J is also required if you’ve taken the CS 46 A/B equivalencies at a different university and those classes did not use Java.
* For students with over 60 units, you have to take MATH 30, MATH 31, and CS 146 in addition to the classes listed in the previous paragraph.
* If you have over 90 units, your application will not be accepted.

**Minimum Requirements**
* In addition to the classes listed above, there is also an SJSU cumulative GPA requirement of 3.7 (as of 03/06/22) to even apply.
* “Applicants must have achieved a sufficiently high GPA in courses that are required to apply”. The GPA is kept purposefully vague, I’d imagine so that the program can adjust their standards according to applicant load in a given cycle. If you are an applicant with under 60 units, aim for the highest grades possible in CS 46 A/B and MATH 42.

**Notes**
* Contrary to what many think, CS 146 is not open only to CS/SE (software engineering) majors (this is relevant if you have 60+ units and want to switch). Anyone can take the class. The catch is that CS/SE majors have priority for these classes and non-majors need instructor consent. Check out the Add Codes section and follow the advice there to maximize your chances of adding the class as a non-major.
* CS 46A and CS 46B are also incredibly difficult classes to get as a non-major. Check out the Add Codes section to maximize your chances. You will likely not be able to be picky with class times or professors. From my understanding, MATH 42 is easier to enroll in since it has more significant overlap with other majors (and hence more class offerings).

**Q: “I’m an incoming freshman! What’s the quickest way to switch into CS?”**

<details open>
<summary>I have APCS Credit</summary>

### The SJSU Job Security Myth <a name="jobsecurity"></a>

> “Being at the heart of the Silicon Valley, SJSU students have a great advantage during internships and job searches!”

I see this and similar sentiments thrown around a lot and thought I’d address it. Here’s the harsh truth (in my opinion): SJSU’s C.S. program is objectively average, or at least not as amazing as some people tout it to be. The program is solid but falls short compared to the mid to higher ranked UCs and similarly ranked private programs. Classes are easier due to more lenient curves and standards, natural results of laxer acceptance rates. The program itself does not go as technically in-depth as more difficult programs, research is few and far between, and elective options seem lacking at times.

The program is absolutely worth it for the cost, but ignoring the cost-utility analysis, the program on its own is not special. You’re going to need to work just as hard if not harder than anyone else for internships and jobs. Your success in these areas is dependent primarily on your own abilities and efforts rather than your school name.

The only advantage you have as an SJSU student is being at a closer proximity to physical internships during the school year. However, even this advantage is dwindling due to COVID pushing everything online. **You’ll have virtually no advantage when applying for Summer internships**, which are generally the highest regarded. Students from all over return to the Bay Area, and physical proximity is no longer an issue for them. At that point, you’ll be competing with the Cals, UCLAs, and Stanfords. And it’ll be your own ability, not your school name, that lands you that internship or job.

Another “selling point” about SJSU I hear often is that many of the local Silicon Valley companies come to job fairs because of student quality and distance. But, in my experience, this is also very exaggerated. Rarely is there a company that exclusively comes to SJSU—they cast as wide of a net as possible to as many decent schools as they can to find talent, including SJSU. Packed job fairs with CS opportunities at any half-decent school are common, and at least based on my experience with them, not any more special at SJSU.

I know it sounds like I’m absolutely bashing SJSU here, and that’s because I am being purposefully harsh for the sake of honesty. The CS program here is no doubt solid, but I find the reputation it has garnered a bit misleading.

Pessimism aside, there are plenty of great things about the C.S. program and SJSU in general. One is that most professors are here only to teach and don’t have research commitments. Another is that class sizes are far, far smaller than UCs and you actually get to talk to your professors instead of only a TA. “Easier” coursework also means less stress (see this very interesting Stanford study on the concept of [Big Fish Little Pond](https://ed.stanford.edu/news/stanford-education-study-provides-new-evidence-big-fish-little-pond-effect-students-globally#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBig%2Dfish%2Dlittle%2Dpond%E2%80%9D%20is%20a%20concept,achieving%20settings%20have%20more%20confidence.) in education) and will allow you more time to build projects or pursue other interests outside of the classroom.

Don't feel discouraged if you’re enrolling here—you’ll just need to work hard for what you want (which is a given at other schools, too). You’ll have plenty of smart, hardworking peers and great professors.

> I think a lot of people presume the SJSU CS program is mediocre, and yeah it's not going to have as many research opportunities as private and well funded universities. I think that's the major drawback of a state school—not having as many research opportunities and possible elective choices, But, there are so many resources online that I wouldn't be discouraged by it. 
> 
> Try not to compare yourself to people from other schools like I did a lot. The fact is an engineer from SJSU can be just as good and better than one from Bekeley, but that's in your hands. CS in general is a major that truly depends on what you put into outside of the classroom. Listening to lectures alone is not enough no matter what program or school you’re enrolled in. It’s how you take that knowledge and work on applying it that will make you the better software engineer.

### Tutoring
There are two primary sources of school-sponsored, free tutoring: [Peer Connections](https://www.sjsu.edu/peerconnections/index.php) and [COSAC Tutoring](https://www.sjsu.edu/cosac/tutoring/cosac-tutoring/index.php). I can’t say anything about them because I never utilized either resource, but I hear that the student tutors are often hit-or-miss. I’d ask around for more opinions or just try it out yourself.

Peer Connections tutors most subjects but doesn’t go too deep into CS upper division courses. A current snapshot of [this list](https://www.sjsu.edu/peerconnections/programs/courses.php) shows that they tutor 22A/B, 46A/B, 47, 49J, 122, 146, 147, 149, 151, 157A, 166, and 171.

COSAC will cover more CS upper division courses but won’t cover anything non-science.

### Office Hours <a name="officehours"></a>
The average student criminally under-utilizes office hours. Too many students don’t ask for help when they’re confused (myself included), often due to laziness, procrastination, anxiety/fear of looking dumb, or a combination of all three. It is incredibly easy to snowball in classes, especially for CS topics that build off of each other.
* If you’re confused on a topic or slightly falling behind and the reason you’re not going to office hours is due to laziness or procrastination, I’ll give you a swift, virtual kick and tell you to go. It’ll only benefit yourself.
* If you feel anxiety or fear looking dumb in front of your professor, I will say that the vast, vast majority of professors (and all of the professors I’ve had the experience of learning from), won’t judge you for being confused. Many professors rarely get feedback from students, so your own experience can actually help the professor measure how effective their teaching is mid-semester instead of having to wait for course evaluations at the end. And honestly, your professor has 100% seen worse.

Please go to office hours if you need help. Don't wait.

### Email Etiquette <a name="email"></a>
> :warning: **BEFORE YOU SEND A SINGLE EMAIL, [please read this](https://www.unr.edu/writing-speaking-center/student-resources/writing-speaking-resources/email-etiquette-for-students). Your professors will thank you.**

### Calendars
I strongly encourage you to utilize Google Calendar or a similar agenda/calendar service. Before the semester begins, I would add all of my class times to my Google Calendar. Once the semester begins and syllabi are released, I would spend 1-2 hours populating it with Office Hours, due dates for homework assignments, and quiz/exam dates.

I’ve included a snapshot of last week to give you an idea of what my calendar looks like. I have Office Hours hidden, but can enable them when I want. Spending 1-2 hours at the beginning of the semester to do this saves you far more time throughout the semester, especially when you need to figure out when your professor’s office hours are.
