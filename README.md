## Introduction 
### Overview
Hello! This guide was written to consolidate and organize information about SJSU’s Computer Science program to help you best navigate your CS degree.
	
I am not an advisor, so take my words with a grain of salt. Verify everything yourself and check with an advisor if possible. Program requirements can and do change, so do your due diligence if you’re reading in the future.

### It's not a race
Please recognize that school, and life in general, really isn’t a race.

I realize that this guide puts a lot of emphasis on the goal of “graduating in four years”, but please don’t feel pressured to do so to the point where you sacrifice important things like mental health or extracurriculars that make you happy. This guide was written by someone who did not need to work while in school. You know your capabilities and responsibilities the best, so take school at a pace that works for you.

So let me reiterate: **it is not a race**. Be honest and realistic about your own capabilities and take your degree at a pace that allows you to thrive.

## Program
Let me reiterate that programs do change, and that the program information below may not be perfectly accurate. Please do your due diligence.

|------|-----------------------------------------------|-------|

### Major Preparation
#### Required Classes
| Code     | Area             | Notes |
|----------|------------------|-------|
| MATH 30  | Calculus 1       |       |
| MATH 31  | Calculus 2       |       |
| MATH 42  | Discrete Math    |       |
| MATH 39  | Linear Algebra 1 |       |
| PHIL 134 |                  |       |
#### Approved Science Electives (CSCI Science Electives)
Formal Requirement:
* 14 units total are required
* At least 5 units must come from Special Science Electives Courses (PHYS 50, PHYS 51, CHEM 1A, BIOL 31, BIOL 30, GEOL 1, GEOL 4L, GEOL 7, METR 10)
* The remaining 9 units can be Special Science Electives, GE Science Courses, or an Area R course

What It Means:
* Basically, the CS department is saying “plz take an extra science class or two” but veils it in this super confusing 14-unit requirement.
* Since so many classes cover both this requirement and certain GEs, if you choose classes strategically, it’s likely you’ll only need to take a single “extra” science+lab class for full coverage.

How to Cover:
* Your classes for GE Area B1 (Physical Science) and B2 (Life Science) will cover at least 6 units
* Strategically choose your classes for B1 and B2 so that they double-dip into the 6-unit Special Science Electives Courses requirement (Example: PHYS 50 for B1/B3, GLST 1B for B2 is already 6 units)
* B3 (Lab Science) will cover at least 1 unit, for a total of 7 units
* Your Area R course will automatically cover (at least) 3 units, for a total of 10 units
* Assuming 7 units from Area B and 3 from Area R, you’ll only need 4 more units at most. That’s one 4-unit science + lab class.

#### Advanced Math (choose 1 of the 3)
| Code      | Area                               | Notes |

| MATH 32   | Calculus 3                         |       |
| MATH 142  | Introduction to Combinatorics      |       |
| MATH 161A | Applied Probability and Statistics |       |
