Hello! This guide was written to consolidate and organize information about SJSU’s Computer Science program to help you best navigate your CS degree.
	
I am not an advisor, so take my words with a grain of salt. Verify everything yourself and check with an advisor if possible. Program requirements can and do change, so do your due diligence if you’re reading in the future.

## It's not a race
<p>
Please recognize that school, and life in general, really isn’t a race.

I realize that this guide puts a lot of emphasis on the goal of “graduating in four years”, but please don’t feel pressured to do so to the point where you sacrifice important things like mental health or extracurriculars that make you happy. This guide was written by someone who did not need to work while in school. You know your capabilities and responsibilities the best, so take school at a pace that works for you.

So let me reiterate: it is not a race. Be honest and realistic about your own capabilities and take your degree at a pace that allows you to thrive.
